          <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            Other than machine learning models, data analytics consist of much more elements
            such as math and domain understanding. I love using 
            various statistical and technological techniques to fully understand the 
            dataset and problem of the projects I am on.

          <h3>Visualization and Communication</h3>
          <p>
            Every project starts and ends with communication. 
            From projects objectives to visualization and insights discussion,
            I love working with others and contributing my value to the 
            team in order to streamline processes.

            Learning and Tinkering
          </h3>
          <p>
            Whether is it building a computer, tinkering with linux and machines or
            just trying out new technology to improve my work process,
            I love learning about new technologies and pick up new skills.
            I am very adaptable to new changes and will always strive 
            to achieve my goals efficiently and effectively.
