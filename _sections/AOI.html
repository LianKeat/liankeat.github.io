          <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            Data analytics is much more than building machine learning models -- 
            it includes elements like math and domain understanding. 
            I love using various statistical and technological techniques 
            to fully understand the dataset and problems I am working on

          <h3>Visualization and Communication</h3>
          <p>
            Every project starts and ends with communication.
             I love working with others and contributing to my team to help 
             streamline the processes of visualisation and insight discussions.

          <h3>Learning and Tinkering</h3>
          <p>
            Whether is it building a computer, tinkering with linux and machines or
            just trying out new technology to improve my workflow,
            I love learning about new technologies and picking up new skills.
            I am very adaptable to changes and will always strive 
            to achieve my goals efficiently and effectively.
