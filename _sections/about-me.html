                I am an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and will be graduating in December 2021. 
                After I graduate, I will be on the lookout for Data Science or Machine Learning Engineering opportunities to help me grow and learn.
                <br>
                I love tinkering with codes, datasets and machines, looking at multiple angles and finding creatives ways to solve problems. 
                Additionally, I love learning, challenging myself with new projects and adding value to the people I work with.
                <br>
                Having the opportunity to work and grow at my two previous internships at Hewlett-Packard (HP) as a Data Science Intern and Illumina 
                as a Business Analyst Intern,
                I am confident and ready to bring my experience and skills to make a difference.
