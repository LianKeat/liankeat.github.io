                I am currently studying at National Unversity of Singapore (NUS) and be will be graduating at the end of this year (Dec 2021). 
                I will be on a lookout for Data Science/Machine Learning Engineer job opportunities to allow me to continue to learn and grow after I graduate.
                <br>
                I love tinkering with codes, datasets and machines. 
                Once I start on a project, I love looking at multiple angles and finding new ways to solve the problem.
                This pushes my desire for knowledge to get better at what I like doing. 
                Other than enjoying the learning process, I would also love to provide value to the people I work with.<br>
                Having the opportunty to work and grow at my two previous internships at Hewlett-Packard (HP) as a Data Science Intern and at Illumina 
                as a Business Analyst,
                I am confident and ready to bring my experience and skills to make a difference.
