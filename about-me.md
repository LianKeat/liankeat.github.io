# The Start of my Journey
Despite taking a Biomedical Engineering degree out of interest, I realised that I did not enjoy what I was learning. 
What I did realised was that I was interested in tinkering and many aspects of programming. 
Unknowningly, I kept looking for ways to bring in programming into my projects, making them much more enjoyable. 
Realising that that my degree might not provide me the job I will be interested in,
I sought for an alternate path and stumble upon the intersection of my interests, Data Science.

# Building Towards Graduation
Being a non Mathematics and Computer Science major, I knew that I was lacking in both knowledge and experience. I started to take up more
statistical/programming related module and even a Statistics minor. I took up multiple online courses such as the "Data Scientist with Python" track 
by DataCamp and "MITx Micromaster in Data Science and Statistics" by EDX to learn Python, SQL and Statistics. 
Equipped with these skills, I interned at Illumina as a Business Analyst where I was given the liberty to produce dashboards in Plotly and Tableau
and automate many processes with Python and VBA. My next intern at Hewlett-Packard (HP) as a Data Science intern allowed to me to build confidence and 
gain experience in an actual field in Data Science. It taught me that Data Science is not just about building ML models, but it includes various 
important aspects such as providing meaning actionable insights to shareholders and the understanding and rectification of current models to tackle 
data/concept drift. 

As I embark on my personal projects and future job opportunities, I am excited to provide value and support to my team and the people I work with.


# Hobbies
Other than taking courses and doing my projects, I play OverWatch, Netflix (like almost everyone these days) or just watch techies shows on Youtube 
(like LinusTechTips). I do go to the gym often, but I do love to play sports like Touch Rugby. I play with a Touch club (Todaks) every Saturday morning.
